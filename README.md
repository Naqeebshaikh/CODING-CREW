# DSA Coding Challenge

Welcome to our **Coding-Crew**! This repository is dedicated to enhancing coding skills, preparing for placements, and improving problem-solving abilities through rigorous practice. Over the course of this challenge, I solved problems related to arrays, strings, two-pointers, sliding windows, binary search, SQL, Linked-list, Stacks and Queues.

**The first Seven days involved tackling specific problems on designated topics each day.**
